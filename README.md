Description:
--------------------
Create an efficient and user-friendly to-do list application using React with the ability to add new tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed by changing their text color to green. This project will help you practice React's fundamental concepts such as state management, component composition, and event handling.

Key Features:
------------------
-Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list by entering the task description and clicking an "Add" button.

-ask Deletion: Each task item has a "Delete" button that allows users to remove unwanted tasks from the list.

-Task Completion: Users can mark a task as completed by clicking a "Complete" button. Completed tasks will have their text color changed to green, making it easy to distinguish between completed and pending tasks.

Technologies Used:
------------------

-React: The project is built using the React library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture simplifies the management of tasks and their state.

-JavaScript: JavaScript is used for implementing the logic behind adding, deleting, and completing tasks.

-CSS: CSS is utilized to style the to-do list items and buttons. The text color change for completed tasks is also managed through CSS.

Component Structure:
--------------------

-App Component: This is the root component that holds the state of the to-do list and manages the logic for adding, deleting, and completing tasks.

-Task Component: This component represents an individual task item, displaying its description, a "Delete" button, and a "Complete" button. The text color change for completed tasks is handled here.

Workflow:
-------------

-Users can enter a task description in an input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the to-do list.

-Each task item is displayed with a "Delete" button that allows users to remove it from the list when it's no longer needed.

-To mark a task as completed, users can click the "Complete" button associated with the task. This action changes the text color to green, indicating that the task is done.













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
